# Learning Roadmap Generator
This project will be an open-source tool that takes a topic, a user's current knowledge level, and their learning style preferences, and then generates a personalized, adaptive learning pathway. It won't teach the content directly (that's for future, more complex projects), but rather guide the learner through a curated sequence of existing resources (articles, videos, interactive exercises, books, etc.).

### Project Goals:
- Core Pathway Generation: An algorithm that can take user inputs and generate a logical, step-by-step learning path.
- Resource Integration (Initial): Integration with a few popular, open-access educational platforms (e.g., Wikipedia, Khan Academy, YouTube educational channels).
- User Interface (Basic): A simple web-based interface for users to input their preferences and view their generated pathway.
- Extensibility: Architecture to be easily expandable with new resource types, learning models, and personalization parameters.
- Community Engagement: Initial contributions and feedback from the open-source community are welcome.
